# 90 Days MERN

## From bland products to aesthetic ones, we go as we learn

Welcome to 90 days of MERN Stack, where we learn NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB and ReactJS without any AI tools except for debugging and learning. We do 90 days, 90 different features. We learn from different public repositories, refactor our bland codes line by line everyday and slowly grow towards industrial practices. And hell yeah, we strive towards making our code more scalable and developer friendly

We thoroughly explain what we are doing with comments. Many features because from many different scenarios and edge cases we can learn many different features of our own stack tools!

P.S. The readme is not generated by ChatGPT :p
