# 90 Days MERN

## From bland products to aesthetic ones, we go as we learn

Welcome to 90 days of MERN Stack, where we learn NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB and ReactJS without any AI tools except for debugging and learning. We do 90 days, 90 different features. We learn from different public repositories, refactor our bland codes line by line everyday and slowly grow towards industrial practices. And hell yeah, we strive towards making our code more scalable and developer friendly

We thoroughly explain what we are doing with comments. Many features because from many different scenarios and edge cases we can learn many different features of our own stack tools!

Also we dropdown articles and blogs we read too as we go along, including any books that we touch to read for Javascript and React

P.S. The readme is not generated by ChatGPT :p

## Day 1

On server side: 

npm i express mongoose nodemon dotenv
Create Product controller, model and route
Setup the index.js to handle express app, express.json() to parse json data

On client side: 

npm create vite@latest
npm i axios dotenv react-router-dom
Use useState and useEffect to create and get products from the backend
The backend call is done using axios.get or axios.post

Fixes:

1. For mongodb error: MongoNetworkError: 48380000:error:0A000438:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:tlsv1 alert internal error,
just configure ip address to be 0.0.0.0

2. Use cors like this and before configuring any routes that is:
app.use(cors(
    {origin:[``,``], allowedHeaders}   for more than origin use array of origins, cors takes an object of configurations
))

3. We cannot write:
await axios.post(`${BASE_URL}/api/products/createProduct`, {
                product.name,
                product.price,
                product.category
})

Since axios expects in the body, key value pairs, we write:

await axios.post(`${BASE_URL}/api/products/createProduct`, {
                name: product.name,
                price: product.price,
                category: product.category
})

Also we cannot write: 

const product= {name: "" , price: ""}

axios.post(url, product) unless the backend is exactly expecting the single object which
it can then destructure and get the properties, in our case our backend is expecting the attributes themselves!


4. With useEffect array dependency adding [, createProduct] for getAllProducts auto
brings the changes without any refresh as soon as we create a product, the "," is a must
as it says empty array condition and createArray condition.
